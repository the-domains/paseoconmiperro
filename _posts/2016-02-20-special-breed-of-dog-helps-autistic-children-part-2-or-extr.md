description: "Marc-Antoine has severe Autism and being paired with Tartin has transformed the way he connects with his surroundings. He has made a friend for life. The MIRA Foundation, a guide and service dog training centre in Quebec, found that a child's behaviour and stress level was much lower after a dog was introduced into a family, benefiting Marc-Antoine and his family after just 10 weeks."
